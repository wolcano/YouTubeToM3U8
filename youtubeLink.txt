## FORMAT: <channel name> || <channel id> || <category>
## <channel name> can be anything - either stream or channel name. It will appear on the EPG though.
## <channel id> is used to match EPG data to the M3U8 playlist, so make it short and with no spaces. End it in '.yt' to show its from YouTube.
## <category> is used to group streams, so something like 'Music' or 'News' is recommended.
